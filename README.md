# Information Systems Design project: Classy
<b>50.001: Introduction to Information Systems and Design</b>

During class, professors have experienced occasions when they ask, “...do you understand?” or “ ...is there any questions” but receive silence as the answer. There are perhaps various reasons for these reactions but our application seeks to address the situations where the students are too shy or not confident enough to ask questions during lessons. Programmed using Java, our application not only seeks to encourage communication between teacher and students but also enhance their overall learning experience.
